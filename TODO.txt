/**
 * what are the list of game events i need to have happen on each game tick?
 *  - gain a resource - based on currentResource and currentSkill from state
 *  - increment a quest step - based on currentActivty and currentQuest from state
 *  - handle a round of combat - based on currentTarget and currentSkill from state
 *
 */

if(player is in combat){
    handle a round of combat- if this kills an enemy, handle that as well
//! work on functions to handle a combat exchange
} else if (player is skilling){
    roll to gain a resource and give xp - may need to trigger a bank run (need to define this lol)
//! work on functions to handle a skilling exchange
} else if (player is questing) {
//! work on functions to handle incrementing a quest step
    handle incrementing a quest step (maybe 10 game ticks for a quest step to increment)
}



* quest panel needs to rerender on every quest step incrementing
* game container needs to respond quicker to completing a quest
