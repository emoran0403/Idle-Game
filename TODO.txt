//# Fixes I need to do
//! logging in with a username/pass not in db crashes lol
//! double check registering a new player in class
//! clean up the lobby into panels or some other layout

//# Fixes that can wait
//! Logic - experience and levels is displaying too high for some reason :/
//! display which quests and levels are missing for quests in quest panel - array.every + array.includes
//! get a changelog from github for the lobby
//! display the stupid images lol
//! get github api key for commit history - changelog
//! remove boilerplate commits

//# Future Updates
//? implement player lifepoints
//? more locations
//? bosses
//? clue scrolls
//? maybe make the game choose the next available quest automatically
//? offline progress
//? show location of quest in questlist component
//? high scores list - read multiple MongoDB call
