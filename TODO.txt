* create a login page
* set up react router dom - which version?
//# does browser router wrap rtk provider, or vice-versa? - does not matter
* - login page, game page
* mongo - how to store and retrieve data?
* auth - will need to tweak auth since data is coming back differently than from sql


//# Fixes I need to do
//! game - set up a way to save progress to local storage
//! server - connect to db to save data
//! server - make a way for players to login
//! server - connect to db to read data upon logging in

//# Fixes that can wait
//! Logic - experience and levels is displaying too high for some reason :/
//! Visual - quest list component does not display progress bar updates when progressing through a quest
//! Visual - target should highlight red when a combat style is chosen, but a target hasnt been selected yet
//! Visual - inventory component should display the item display names
//! Visual - bankPanel component should display the item display names - need to do some indexing from constants
//! Visual - level ups send a chatlog


//# Future Updates
//? shop to buy equipment
//? implement player lifepoints
//? more locations
//? bosses
//? clue scrolls
//? maybe make the game choose the next available quest automatically
//? offline progress
//? show location of quest in questlist component
