if(player is in combat){
    handle a round of combat- if this kills an enemy, handle that as well
//! work on functions to handle a combat exchange
} else if (player is skilling){
    roll to gain a resource and give xp - may need to trigger a bank run (need to define this lol)
//! work on functions to handle a skilling exchange
} else if (player is questing) {
done work on functions to handle incrementing a quest step
    handle incrementing a quest step (maybe 10 game ticks for a quest step to increment)
}

//! experience and levels is displaying too hig for some reason :/



//? maybe make the game choose the next available quest automatically
