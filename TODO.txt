/**
 * what are the list of game events i need to have happen on each game tick?
 *  - gain a resource - based on currentResource and currentSkill from state
 *  - increment a quest step - based on currentActivty and currentQuest from state
 *  - handle a round of combat - based on currentTarget and currentSkill from state
 *
 */

if(player is in combat){
    handle a round of combat- if this kills an enemy, handle that as well
//! work on functions to handle a combat exchange
} else if (player is skilling){
    roll to gain a resource and give xp - may need to trigger a bank run (need to define this lol)
//! work on functions to handle a skilling exchange
} else if (player is questing) {
done work on functions to handle incrementing a quest step
    handle incrementing a quest step (maybe 10 game ticks for a quest step to increment)
}





//# Fixes I need to do
//! skilling tick does not respect the inventory max of 28
//! need a way to check for inventory fullness and transition to a banking state
//! need a banking state that is triggered upon filling the inventory

//! this should not overwrite the skilling state, and instead maybe pause those actions?

//! skilling currently does not respect the state of banking / dropping items

//# Fixes that can wait
//! experience and levels is displaying too high for some reason :/
//! quest list component does not display progress bar updates when progressing through a quest
//! target should highlight red when a combat style is chosen, but a target hasnt been selected yet
//! bankPanel should display the item display names - need to do some indexing from constants


//# Future Updates
//? maybe make the game choose the next available quest automatically
