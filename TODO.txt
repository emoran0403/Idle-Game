* mongo - how to store and retrieve data?
* auth - will need to tweak auth since data is coming back differently than from sql


* how to i reconcile the checkpoint data in local and the saved data in the database?
* why do i need / want local data?
 - if the player closes the tab without hitting logout, they could lose ~5 mins worth of progress
  - if there is local data, and db data, which one do i use?
   - timestamp the object - and use the data with the most recent timestamp

* im going to have jwt in localstorage as well as the checkpoint data


//# Fixes I need to do
//! game - set up a way to save progress to local storage
//! server - connect to db to save data
//! server - make a way for players to login and retrieve data
//! server - connect to db to read data upon logging in
//! DB - need a way to add player auth info the player object in global storage

//# Fixes that can wait
//! Logic - experience and levels is displaying too high for some reason :/
//! Visual - target should highlight red when a combat style is chosen, but a target hasnt been selected yet
//! Visual - inventory component should display the item display names
//! Visual - bankPanel component should display the item display names - need to do some indexing from constants
//! Visual - skilling levels send a message, quests and combat do not - issue with sending more than 1 message at a time i think


//# Future Updates
//? implement player lifepoints
//? more locations
//? bosses
//? clue scrolls
//? maybe make the game choose the next available quest automatically
//? offline progress
//? show location of quest in questlist component
//? high scores list - read multiple MongoDB call
