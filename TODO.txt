* mongo - how to store and retrieve data?
* auth - will need to tweak auth since data is coming back differently than from sql


* how to i reconcile the checkpoint data in local and the saved data in the database?
* why do i need / want local data?
 - if the player closes the tab without hitting logout, they could lose ~5 mins worth of progress
  - if there is local data, and db data, which one do i use?
   - timestamp the object - and use the data with the most recent timestamp

* im going to have jwt in localstorage as well as the checkpoint data

when loading data from local storage or from mongo, how do i set that to state?
 - normalize the data?


//# Fixes I need to do
//! game - set up a way to save progress to local storage
//! server - connect to db to save data
//! server - make a way for players to login and retrieve data
//! server - connect to db to read data upon logging in
//! DB - need a way to add player auth info the player object in global storage
//! clean up the lobby into panels or some other layout

//# Fixes that can wait
//! Logic - experience and levels is displaying too high for some reason :/
//! display which quests and levels are missing for quests in quest panel
//! get a changelog from github for the lobby


//# Future Updates
//? implement player lifepoints
//? more locations
//? bosses
//? clue scrolls
//? maybe make the game choose the next available quest automatically
//? offline progress
//? show location of quest in questlist component
//? high scores list - read multiple MongoDB call
