/**
 * what are the list of game events i need to have happen on each game tick?

if(player is in combat){
    handle a round of combat- if this kills an enemy, handle that as well
//! work on functions to handle a combat exchange
} else if (player is skilling){
    roll to gain a resource and give xp - may need to trigger a bank run (need to define this lol)
//! work on functions to handle a skilling exchange
} else if (player is questing) {
done work on functions to handle incrementing a quest step
    handle incrementing a quest step (maybe 10 game ticks for a quest step to increment)
}





//# Fixes I need to do

//# Fixes that can wait
//! Logic - experience and levels is displaying too high for some reason :/
//! Visual - quest list component does not display progress bar updates when progressing through a quest
//! Visual - target should highlight red when a combat style is chosen, but a target hasnt been selected yet
//! Visual - inventory component should display the item display names
//! Visual - bankPanel component should display the item display names - need to do some indexing from constants


//# Future Updates
//? implement player lifepoints
//? shop to buy equipment
//? more locations
//? bosses
//? clue scrolls
//? maybe make the game choose the next available quest automatically
//? offline progress
