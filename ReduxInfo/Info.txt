The application state will be the players level, xp, inventory, loot inventory, quest progress
All the above information will be contained in the redux store 
?(do i use 1 big store for everything, or can i use multiple?)

The action object to update state will be the result of each player action
cut wood (gain xp, get item), kill monster (gain xp in multiple skills, set item into loot inventory), complete quest step, etc

this will then be dispatched to the store to update the state

subscribers will be the players level interface and inventory interfaces

!============================== right from the tutorial
? pausing this for now until i get further into the tutorial lol
define initialState as inventory and xp
const initialState = {
  logs: 0,
  ashes: 0,
  woodcuttingXP: 0,
  firemakingXP: 0
}

for woodcutting - gain a log, and woodcuttingXP
function gainLogs(state = initialState, action) {
  return { ...state, logs: state.logs + 1, woodcuttingXP: state.woodcuttingXP + 25 }
}

for firemaking - lose a log, gain ashes, gain firemakingXP
function burnLogs(state = initialState, action) {
    return { ...state, logs: state.logs -1, ashes: state.ashes + 1, firemakingXP: state.firemakingXP + 25 }
}
