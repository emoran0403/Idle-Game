? pausing this for now until i get further into the tutorial lol
define initialState as inventory and xp
const initialState = {
  logs: 0,
  ashes: 0,
  woodcuttingXP: 0,
  firemakingXP: 0
}

for woodcutting - gain a log, and woodcuttingXP
function gainLogs(state = initialState, action) {
  return { ...state, logs: state.logs + 1, woodcuttingXP: state.woodcuttingXP + 25 }
}

for firemaking - lose a log, gain ashes, gain firemakingXP
function burnLogs(state = initialState, action) {
    return { ...state, logs: state.logs -1, ashes: state.ashes + 1, firemakingXP: state.firemakingXP + 25 }
}
