Quests:
each location will have a quest option, showing the quests that are started in that location
this interface will also show
- quests the player can start now
- unattained levels the player needs before starting the quest
- previous quest requirements (if space allows)
- the time required to complete each quest
- rewards
- quests requiring combat will be noted with some icon

!================================================================

Quests:
- Just run down a timer to complete the quest
- Difficulty, length, skill requirements, item requirements, and enemies to defeat will contribute to the timer
- assign some number to each difficulty
- assign some number to each length
- use the number of skill requirements as a small multiplier
- use the actual skill level requirements as a number
- assign some number to the amount of items required
- assign some number based on the combat level of the enemies to defeat
- maybe count the headers on the wiki, and the number of p tags following them for the number of 'steps' in the quest

!================================================================

Actual Guide Page:
?Count the headers to translate into time

document.getElementsByClassName('mw-headline') will grab the headers
10 headers need to be subtracted from this value as they correspond to the headers below:
Official description, overview, rewards, Achievements, Required for completing, Transcript, Gallery, Credits, Update history, Trivia

!================================================================

Quick Guide Page:
?Count the individual steps to translate into time

document.getElementsByClassName('lighttable checklist') will grab the tables containing the steps listed
.children gives the ul
.children gives the li (with a div, this div is the 'uncheck all' button)
thus, .length -1 will give the number of steps

??? subtract 2 from length, as the first 2 are item checklists
OR keep that to represent the time taken to get those items
