we can implement the idea of difficulty by lowering(easier) or raising(harder) the number randNum is compared to




Gathering skill loop:
walk to resource 
gather resource
 - repeat until inventory is full
 walk to bank ( instant deposit to make things easy ) 
 walk back to location


time taken to walk can be halved by using run energy
every (or every other) tick of the timer is a chance to get a resource
chance of gathering resources increased with higher level, equipment, other future buffs


EX: woodcutting runs on a 1 sec timer, lvl 1 with bronze axe gives a 20% chance to get a log
go through X loops to fill inventory, then start walking back to bank


Combat: (Non-Boss)

each location will have a combat option, showing the monsters in the current location in some interface
this interface will also show
- their level compared to the player's level
- time the player can stay in combat
- their loot
- slayer level requirement if any


use combat skills (or combat level) and gear to generate some number
use monster combat stats to determine to generate some number
subtract monster number from player number, and translate this to some time a player can stay and kill monsters
monsters take some amount of time to kill, based on their stats

every kill will add some loot to a loot table
player can add some items to their inventory while in combat

after players time is up, the player can add items from loot table to their inventory

LATER: consumables can add to player time
